## SuperNova Storybook Mobile Swift

This is an imaginary project that shows how to use the SuperNova Storybook in a mobile app. It was generated by AI using VSCode Agent + Claude 3.7 Sonnet + Prompt Booster by chrisdias.dev.

### Original Prompt

```
boost this prompt: I want to create dummy documentation for demonstration purposes for an imaginary libravy called SuperNovaStorybook-Mobile-Swift. It'll have an index.html for documentation home. It should have components for screen, view, header, title, subtitle, body, footer, hero card. It'll have documentation for each component, public properties and method descriptions. It'll also have an API changes section. Opening the index.html lands us on documentation home page and give us intro, then what changed in this version, then list of componet as their dedicated pages. Since it's an imaginary documentation -- it does not have to be extensive, but it has to be somewhat comprehensive and represent a real life documentation. Any questions before you start? Clarify with questions before you start modifying. This documentation will be simple html+css+js based doc only used locally by devs in situation. The folder and basic files are already created
```
